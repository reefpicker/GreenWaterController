'Assigment file
'For devices, assign a device number to a relay
'by using the following statment
'Device X = Relay N as NAME
'where X is the tank or device in the layout, starting from left to right
'for each "section", going left to right
'and N is the LOGICAL relay number in the BOARD
'and NAME is the name given to the tank.
'For the pump write PUMP = n, where n is the relay number
'
'Board specifies size of board, i.e. use Board = 16 for a 16 relay board
Board = 24
Device 1 = Relay 9 as A1
device 2 = relay 10 as A2
device 3 = relay 11 as A3
device 4 = relay 12 as A4
device 5 = relay 13 as B1
device 6 = relay 14 as B2
device 7 = relay 15 as B3
device 8 = relay 16 as B4
device 9 = relay 21 as C1
device 10 = relay 22 as C2
device 11 = relay 23 as C3
